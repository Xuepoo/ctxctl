## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **`ctx-symbol`** — reusable symbol engine: language-agnostic tree-sitter
  extraction (`Language` trait, `Symbol` with byte ranges into the original
  source), original-source slicing, and doc-comment capture. Backends: Rust,
  TypeScript, Python (docstring-aware, decorators included in slices), Go,
  JavaScript, Java (records/constructors/static+wildcard imports), C
  (declarator chains, typedefs, preprocessor), C++ (templates include
  `template <T>` headers in slices/compact, namespaces, `using`), C#
  (records/structs/properties/fields, `using static`), Ruby
  (`require_relative` local), Lua (`require` paths, `--` markers). Pure AST
  import extraction (`extract_imports`, one target per name for python
  multi-imports) for dependency graphs. `compact_symbol`: signature +
  fold-marker view that re-parses cleanly.
- **`ctx-exec`** — rg-rule-driven command-output compression: head/tail
  summary, keep patterns (`error`, `warning`, `failed`, `panic`, `fatal`,
  case-insensitive), `... [N lines omitted]` fold markers, deterministic
  token-savings stats. Byte-stable by design.
- **`ctxctl`** — CLI shell over both crates: `outline`, `symbol`
  (`--signature`/`--lines`/`--compact`), `read`, `exec` (`--keep`/`--head`/
  `--tail`, exit-code passthrough), `deps`. Global `--format json`/`--json`,
  `--config`, `--no-saved`, `--no-color`. Config resolution
  (`--config` > project `.ctxctl/config.toml` walk-up > XDG > defaults) with
  key-wise merge. `[exec]`, `[outline]` (`fold_threshold` text-mode folding),
  `[paths]` (ignore globs for `deps` classification), `[general]` sections.
  JSON envelopes `{schema_version, tool, path, saved}`; exit codes 0-4;
  byte-stable output targeting provider prompt caching. 78 tests.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **`handoff accept --claim-task` was parsed but ignored** ([#75](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/75)): the flag was destructured away (`claim_task: _`), so accepting a handoff never claimed its task while the `--help` text promised "Automatically claim the associated task upon accepting the handoff". The accepting agent is now resolved and the handoff's task is claimed in the same transaction, mirroring `task claim` (task moves to `in_progress` and its ownership transfers to the accepting agent). If the task cannot be claimed (already owned, wrong status, incomplete dependencies), the whole accept fails with a standard error envelope instead of silently dropping the documented behavior. Regression test: accept as a second agent with `--claim-task` and assert the task is owned and `in_progress`.
- **`handoff show`/`accept`/`reject`/`close` and `progress show` returned a non-standard not-found error** ([#76](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/76)): a missing ref short-circuited with a bare `ExitCode::ResourceNotFound`, printing nothing to stdout and exiting without the standard error envelope — machine consumers (`--json`, MCP) got no parseable error. These commands now route `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` through the standard error path like `task show`: `success:false` envelope on stderr, exit code 7. Regression tests: three new envelope/exit-code assertions.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **`decision list --task` was accepted and ignored** ([#71](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/71)): the command had no `--task` flag of its own, so the global `--task` flag parsed and fell through — `decision list --task CTX-0320` returned every decision in the project, and a nonexistent ref returned the full dump with no error, unlike `progress list --task` which filters and validates. `decision list` now has a real `--task <ref>` flag: the ref is resolved and validated first (`RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` for a bad ref), and the query narrows to that task's decisions. Regression test: filtered list must narrow the row count and every row must belong to the requested task.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **`task create --description` was parsed and then discarded** ([#70](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/70)): the flag destructured the value and never forwarded it, so every task was created with `description = NULL` while reporting success, and no CLI path could fill the field afterwards (`task edit` exposed only `--title` and `--priority`). `--description` is now threaded through `create_task` into the insert (the `NewTask`/SQL already supported it), and `task edit` gained `--description` so existing tasks can be filled in or revised. The `task.created`/`task.edited` audit payloads now carry the description.
- **`task depend --kind <invalid>` exited 2 with no output at all** ([#69](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/69)): the parse error was constructed and then thrown away by `.map_err(|e| e.exit_code)?`, so neither text mode nor `--json` mode rendered anything — and the `--kind` help text advertised `blocks`/`relates_to`, neither of which is accepted. Invalid kinds now render through the standard error path: text mode prints `Unknown dependency kind: blocks` (JSON envelope on stderr), `--json` mode emits the regular `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` envelope, and the help text documents the real values (`strong` or `informational`, default `strong`; the `info` alias still works). The same silent-discard pattern for `task create/list --status` and `task create/edit --priority` parse failures was fixed identically.
- **`task show`/`task list` compact text ignored `--fields` and `[output.fields]`** ([#68](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/68)): `task_summary`/`tasks_summary` rendered a hardcoded template, so requesting more fields (`depends_on`, `blocks`) showed nothing new, and requesting fewer fields printed empty brackets/padded columns for the removed keys. Under an explicit projection the compact line now renders exactly the projected fields and appends any projected-but-unrendered ones as `label: value` fragments — dependency edges as their `display_id` list, e.g. `CTX-0320 [in_progress] fix(text): … — needs CTX-0321` — so `--fields display_id,status,title,depends_on,blocks` finally shows the edges, `--fields display_id` emits a clean `CTX-0320`, and default (unprojected) output is unchanged.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Broken pipe panicked instead of exiting cleanly**: piping a multi-line compact output to a consumer that stops early (`ctxctl checkpoint list | head -3`, `ctxctl task list | head -1`) crashed with `thread 'main' panicked ... failed printing to stdout: Broken pipe (os error 32)` because `println!` aborts on EPIPE. The panic is now intercepted and converted into the conventional Unix exit code 141 (128 + SIGPIPE), so piped invocations terminate silently like every other CLI. Regression test: a closed stdout pipe must not produce a `panicked` message on stderr.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`agent current --agent <name>` failed with `VALIDATION_FAILED` even when an explicit agent was passed** ([#64](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/64)): the resolver always honored `--agent` (the failure only occurred without it), but the error gave no way to recover. The validation error now lists the available agents — `Multiple agents exist (antigravity, claude-code, kiro, omp, opencode); specify --agent <name>.` — and a regression test locks in that `agent current --agent opencode` resolves the named agent with five agents registered.
- **`task create` buried `display_id` deep inside the JSON output** ([#65](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/65)): every entity command now prints a compact one-line summary in text mode — `Task created: CTX-0321` — so the next action (`task start`, `progress note --task`, `handoff create --task`) needs no JSON parsing or second query.

### Changed

- **Compact text output by default.** Text mode (`--format text`, the default) no longer dumps pretty-printed full records for entity commands (`task.*`, `agent.*`, `checkpoint.*`, `handoff.*`, `session.*`, `progress.*`, `decision.*`, `worktree.*`, `event.*`, `search`, `status`). It emits one short line per record with only high-attention fields (`display_id`, status, title/summary, short IDs), keeping agent context small on real projects — e.g. `status` on a 320-task project went from a multi-megabyte pretty JSON blob to a 6-line summary plus the active tasks. ULIDs are truncated to 8 chars, timestamps to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, free text to 80 chars.
- **Full detail on demand.** `--verbose` (global flag) or `[output] verbose = true` in `.ctxctl/config.toml` restores the previous full pretty-printed text output. JSON output is unchanged and always carries the complete envelope.
- **Field projection.** The new global `--fields display_id,status,summary` flag and the per-command `[output.fields]` table (e.g. `"handoff.list" = ["display_id", "status", "summary"]`) trim entity records to an allowlist in both text and JSON output; the envelope structure is preserved. CLI flags override configuration.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`handoff list` returned every record regardless of status** ([#62](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/pull/62)): measured on a real project the default listing returned 7 handoffs of which 1 was actionable and 6 were closed, making it useless as a session-start check. The default is now pending/open only. `--all` restores the unfiltered view; `--status <state>` selects a specific status (accepts both the persisted SQL spelling — `pending`, `declined` — and the domain name — `open`, `rejected`); `--for-agent <name|ulid|role>` filters by target agent.
- **`handoff create` display-id collisions on rapid inserts** ([#62](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/pull/62)): `handoff create` derived `display_id` by truncating a fresh ULID to 8 characters; two handoffs created inside the same millisecond share that prefix and collide on the unique index. The command now delegates to the application-layer `create_handoff()` and the `sequences`-backed allocator, producing sequential `HO-0001`, `HO-0002`, … ids that never collide. The application-layer function also carried the wrong prefix (`HF`); corrected to `HO` to match all existing records and documentation (the function had no callers before this release, so the wrong prefix never reached production data).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`stats` billed every session to "now"** ([#60](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/60)): `session end`, `session abandon`, and auto-end only updated `state`/`summary`/`updated_at` — `ended_at` had no write site anywhere in the codebase, so `stats` computed `Utc::now() - started_at` for every session, ended or not. An agent with 36 real sessions showed 4784h of "Time Spent". `update_state` now writes `ended_at` on terminal transitions (and `mark_overdue_stale` does too), `stats` falls back to `last_activity_at` instead of `Utc::now()` for sessions still open, and migration `0011` backfills `ended_at = last_activity_at` for pre-0.5.0 terminal sessions.
- **`stats` per-agent Checkpoints column was always 0** ([#60](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/60)): the per-agent subquery joined `checkpoints.session_id = sessions.id`, but checkpoints are never created with a `session_id` (they carry `agent_id`), so the column read 0 while the overview totalled real checkpoints. The count now uses `checkpoints.agent_id`.
- **`handoff create --target <name-or-role>` always failed with `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`** ([#60](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/60)): the `--target` value was inserted verbatim as `to_agent_id`, so anything but a raw agent ULID violated the `agents(id)` FK — despite the help text promising "agent ULID or role name". The target now resolves by name, ULID, or role before insert, with a clear `Target agent '…' not found` error when unresolvable.
- **`task start` after `task claim` errored "Cannot transition from InProgress to start"** ([#60](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/60)): `claim` already moves Ready → InProgress, so the documented claim-then-start workflow could never succeed. `start` on an InProgress task is now an idempotent no-op.
- **Text-mode warnings corrupted the JSON stream** ([#60](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/60)): `render_json_with_warnings` appended `\nwarning: …` after the pretty-printed JSON document on stdout, breaking every `| jq` / `json.load` consumer (surfaced by the 0.4.6 `render_and_print_with_warnings` change). Warnings now go to stderr in text mode; `--json` mode keeps them in the envelope.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **`strict_completion` guard unreachable from the only states `Complete` allows** ([#57](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/57)): `evaluate_transition`'s `(Ac::Complete, St::Review | St::InProgress) => true` arm matched unconditionally, before the arm that denies completion when `strict_completion` is on and the task has open progress items — so that guard could only ever be reached from a state (e.g. `Ready`) where `Complete` was already an invalid transition, reporting a misleading "open progress items" error when the real blocker was the state itself. From `InProgress` with `strict_completion = true` and an open item, `task complete` silently succeeded and the item stayed open. The guard now runs before the unconditional arm.
- **`task <transition>` commands always discarded their warnings** ([#58](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/58)): `SuccessEnvelope.warnings` exists and `evaluate_transition` populates it (e.g. "Task has open progress items." when completing non-strictly), but all 8 transition call sites in `src/commands/task.rs` bound it as `_w` and dropped it before calling `render_and_print`, so the signal never reached JSON or text output. Added `render_and_print_with_warnings` and threaded it through `release`/`start`/`block`/`unblock`/`review`/`complete`/`cancel`/`reopen`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **`decision add --rationale`** ([#55](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/55)): `decisions.rationale` was `NOT NULL` and FTS-indexed but no CLI flag could ever set it, so every decision was stored with `rationale = ''` — the field most worth searching (the "why" behind a decision) was guaranteed to contain nothing. `decision add` now accepts `--rationale <RATIONALE>`, the column is nullable (migration `0010_decision_rationale`, distinguishing "not supplied" from "supplied as empty"), and `decision search` matches against it alongside title/context/decision/consequences.

### Fixed

- **`decision add` display ID collisions on rapid inserts** ([#54](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/54)): `decision add` derived `display_id` by truncating the row's ULID to 8 characters, quantising it to a 1024ms bucket; every decision created within the same bucket produced an identical `display_id`, and since the column is `NOT NULL UNIQUE`, all but the first failed with a raw `DATABASE_ERROR: UNIQUE constraint failed`. `decision add` is now wired through the same `sequences`-backed allocator tasks and progress items already use, producing sequential, human-readable `DEC-0001`, `DEC-0002`, … ids that never collide. Decisions were the only entity affected; tasks and progress items were already unaffected.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Hyphenated search queries** ([#47](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/47)): `ctxctl search aria-owns` no longer passes the bare hyphen directly to SQLite FTS5, where it was parsed as query syntax and failed with the misleading `DATABASE_ERROR: no such column: owns`. Bare terms containing FTS5-special characters are now quoted as literals while existing quoted phrases, uppercase `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, and trailing `*` prefix searches remain supported.
- **npm packages contained no executable**: v0.4.3 corrected the platform package names, but the publish job looked for `ctxctl`/`ctxctl.exe` after the build job had renamed those artifacts to `ctxctl-<target>`, so the four published platform tarballs contained only `package.json`; the initial Windows name `ctxctl-cli-win32-x64` was additionally rejected by npm spam detection, and the root package was consequently skipped. Packaging now copies the actual renamed artifact, keeps the `.exe` suffix on Windows, fails before publication if the binary is missing or empty, verifies the platform tarball payload, uses the accepted `ctxctl-cli-windows-x64` package name, lets every platform job finish independently, makes root publication rerunnable, and performs a clean `npm install --save-dev ctxctl@<version>` plus `ctxctl --version` smoke test against the registry before the release workflow can pass. The v0.4.4 Windows and root packages were recovered under the corrected name and verified from a clean project after the tag workflow failed.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **npm platform packages never actually published**: `ctxctl` on npm has shipped since v0.4.0 as a thin launcher (`ctxctl`) with five per-platform binary packages pulled in via `optionalDependencies`. Those platform packages were failing to publish on every release — CI reported green because the publish step piped its output through `|| echo "npm publish failed (may already exist)"`, silently swallowing the real error. Root cause was two-fold: (1) the platform packages were scoped (`@ctxctl/cli-*`), and npm requires the `@ctxctl` organization to exist before any scoped package can be published — it never did, so every publish 404'd with "Scope not found"; (2) the packaging matrix was missing `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and used raw Rust target triples as package-name suffixes (e.g. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`) instead of the npm platform-package convention (`linux-x64-gnu`) that the root launcher and `optionalDependencies` actually looked up, so even a successful publish would have been unresolvable at runtime. Net effect: every `npm install ctxctl` since v0.4.0 installed a launcher with no binary behind it, and running `ctxctl` failed with `no binary found`. Fixed by renaming the platform packages to unscoped `ctxctl-cli-<platform>` (no org required), aligning the naming with the launcher's runtime resolution, adding the missing `linux-arm64-gnu` target to the publish matrix, and replacing the blanket `|| echo` with a check that only tolerates a version that's already published (any other failure now fails the job).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`ctxctl search`** ([#45](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/45)): full-text search across tasks, progress items, checkpoints, and decisions, backed by SQLite FTS5 and ranked by `bm25()`. Every hit resolves back to the owning task's display ID, status, and (where known) the branch it was worked on — the branch name alone rarely carries what actually changed, which was the whole motivation for the feature. `--type` scopes to one entity kind, `--status`/`--owner` narrow by the owning task's status/owner agent, `--limit` caps result count, and `--format markdown`/`--json` match the rest of the CLI's output contract. `--owner` is deliberately not named `--agent` to avoid the same global-`--agent`/`CTXCTL_AGENT` name-collision bug fixed in `event list` back in 0.2.1. New migration `0009_search.sql` adds one FTS5 virtual table per searchable entity, kept in sync by triggers on insert/update/delete, with a one-time backfill for rows that existed before the migration ran.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Pending migrations were never backfilled onto pre-existing databases** ([#42](https://github.com/Xuepoo/ctxctl/issues/42)): every command opened the project database via `ProjectDatabase::open`, which never applied pending migrations — only `ctxctl init` (via `create_fresh`) and the explicit `ctxctl project migrate` command did. A database created before a new migration shipped (e.g. `0008_jj_compat`) stayed stuck at its old schema version indefinitely; `ctxctl checkpoint` then failed with `DATABASE_ERROR: no column named vcs_backend` while `ctxctl doctor` incorrectly reported `"Schema version up to date"` (a hardcoded string, not an actual check). Every command now backfills pending migrations transparently on open, and `doctor`'s `database.schema` check now genuinely queries `pending_migrations()` and reports `error` with the specific pending migration names if any remain.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **jj colocation detection (Phase 1 of Jujutsu compatibility)**: `ctxctl doctor` now reports an informational `vcs.jj_colocation` check when a `.jj/` directory sits alongside `.git/` (Jujutsu's colocated mode), so users get an explicit signal that CtxCtl sees the jj setup. See `ctxctl-docs/plans/2026-07-25-jujutsu-compatibility.md`.
- **Checkpoint `vcs_backend`/`changed_files` (Phase 2 of Jujutsu compatibility)**: checkpoints now record `vcs_backend: "git" | "jj"` and a `changed_files` list that stays accurate under both backends. Under jj colocation, `staged_files`/`modified_files`/`untracked_files` are now reported as empty instead of a three-way split that jj's automatic working-copy snapshotting makes unreliable (read-only jj commands can write to the Git index as a side effect); `dirty` and diff stats remain accurate under both backends. New migration `0008_jj_compat.sql`.
- **`worktree create` refuses under jj colocation (Phase 3 of Jujutsu compatibility)**: `ctxctl worktree create` now detects jj colocation and refuses with a clear error instead of creating a directory that neither `jj workspace list` recognizes nor ctxctl's own state commands can read from inside (jj's secondary workspaces, created via `jj workspace add`, have no local `.git/` at all). The error points at `jj workspace add` directly, plus `ctxctl worktree bind` from the primary colocated checkout if CtxCtl tracking is needed.
- **`hooks install` refuses under jj colocation (Phase 4 of Jujutsu compatibility)**: `ctxctl hooks install` now detects jj colocation and refuses instead of silently installing `post-commit`/`prepare-commit-msg` hooks that `jj commit`/`jj describe` never trigger (jj writes commits via `jj git export`, bypassing Git's hook mechanism entirely). Points users at manual `ctxctl checkpoint` as the interim workflow.

### Fixed

- **Checkpoint `head` on zero-commit repos**: `GitSnapshot::head` (used by `checkpoint create` and `worktree show`) is now `Option<String>` and reports `null` instead of an empty string `""` when `git rev-parse HEAD` fails (e.g. a brand-new repository with no commits yet, in Git or jj alike), matching how every other "absent" field in the same struct behaves.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Task dependency visibility**: `ctxctl task show` now returns `depends_on` (this task's prerequisites, each annotated with its current status) and `blocks` (tasks that depend on this one), alongside the existing task fields. Previously there was no way to see a task's dependency graph without manually replaying `task depend`/`undepend` history.

### Fixed

- **MCP server stale binary path**: `ctxctl mcp` is a long-lived stdio process. Upgrading `ctxctl` while it's running (cargo/npm/Homebrew/etc.) replaces the binary at the same path; the already-running server keeps its old file handle open and stays functional, but the next tool call that tries to spawn a subprocess via the process's own executable path failed with `No such file or directory`, since that path no longer resolves on disk. The server now detects this and falls back to resolving `ctxctl` from `PATH` (finding whatever is actually installed), and gives an actionable error message if that also fails, instead of a bare OS error.
- **`graph edges <ID>` silently returned an empty list** when given a task, agent, or session ULID instead of an actual Context Graph node ID — those are separate ID spaces. It now checks whether the node exists first and returns a clear error pointing at `task show` for task dependencies instead.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **Progress task inference**: `progress todo`/`block`/`risk`/`note`/`list` no longer require an explicit `--task`. They now resolve the current task the same way `session start`, `checkpoint`, and `context` already do (`--task` → `CTXCTL_TASK` → active session → current worktree → agent's single in-progress task).
- **`checkpoint list --task <DISPLAY_ID>`**: fixed a bug where passing a display ID (e.g. `CTX-0001`) silently returned an empty list. The filter now resolves the display ID to its underlying ULID before querying, and also falls back to `CTXCTL_TASK` when `--task` is omitted.
- **Dependency auto-promotion**: completing a task now re-evaluates its dependents. Any task still sitting in `planned` whose last incomplete strong dependency was just completed is automatically promoted to `ready` (mirroring the existing behavior on `task undepend`), emitting a new `task.unblocked` event. Previously a task created as `planned` had no path back to `ready` once its blocking dependency actually finished.
- **`resume` fallback**: `ctxctl resume` now falls back through the same task-resolution chain as the commands above instead of only checking `--task` or the current active session. Reopening a new window with no active session (the core "resume" scenario) now correctly finds the agent's single in-progress task instead of returning `currentTask: null`.
- **Stale README example**: `progress complete PX-0001 "<text>"` in `README.zh-CN.md` is not valid; `progress complete` takes a single positional argument. Corrected to `progress complete PX-0001`.
- **Homepage URL**: `ctxctl.dev` is not registered yet. `Cargo.toml`'s `homepage` field and both READMEs' documentation links now point at `ctxctl.xuepoo.xyz`, the site actually in production.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Intelligent Context Inference**: Implemented `CurrentEntityResolver::resolve_task` to auto-infer tasks based on current git worktree bindings or single active agent tasks. Removes the strict requirement for explicit `--task` flags in `session start`, `checkpoint`, `context`, and `handoff` commands.
- **Detailed JSON Status**: `ctxctl status` in JSON format now outputs fully detailed arrays for `tasks`, `activeSessions`, `activeAgents`, and `worktrees` instead of just integer counts, greatly improving parsability for LLMs and external tools.

### Fixed

- **Task Timestamps**: Fixed an issue in `SqliteTaskRepository` where `started_at` and `completed_at` timestamps were not being correctly populated in the SQLite database during `in_progress` or `completed` state transitions.
- **Active Session Filtering**: Fixed a bug in `ctxctl status` where the JSON output incorrectly counted _all_ historical sessions as active. It now correctly filters by `SessionState::Active`.
- **Borrow Checker Conflicts**: Resolved complex memory lifetime and mutable borrow conflicts (E0502) related to `UnitOfWork` and transaction management in `checkpoint.rs` and `handoff.rs` by correctly scoping the transaction limits.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Markdown output**: `ctxctl status` now supports `--format markdown` for LLM-friendly output.
- **RUST_LOG tracing**: `RUST_LOG=ctxctl=debug` now produces structured debug output.`

### Fixed

- **Empty repo init**: `ctxctl init` no longer crashes on freshly initialized Git repos with no commits.
- **Event list agent clash**: The local `--agent` flag in `event list` no longer picks up the `CTXCTL_AGENT` env var value and filters by raw agent name instead of ULID.
- **Event list task filter**: `event list --task` now correctly resolves display IDs to ULIDs before querying.
- **Progress list display ID**: `progress list --task ET-0001` now resolves the display ID instead of passing it raw to SQL.
- **Session resume state**: `session resume` now correctly transitions the session from Paused to Active (was using `touch_activity` which didn't change state).
- **Session fallback strings**: Pause/Resume/End/Abandon no longer use "unknown" or "default" placeholder strings.
- **Checkpoint fallback**: Checkpoint creation now properly validates that a task reference is provided.
- **Decision FK violation**: Decision domain struct now includes `task_id` instead of inserting an empty string.
- **Worktree list**: Main repository root no longer appears as an unregistered worktree with empty ID/dates.
- **Stats counting**: `total_sessions` and `total_seconds` now include active (ongoing) sessions.
- **Preset install**: Presets with names containing path separators (e.g. `workflows/bugfix`) now correctly create parent directories.
- **Config panic**: Renamed `--project` bool flag to `--cfg-project` in config commands to avoid clap name clash with the global `--project` flag.
- **Progress reorder**: SQL `CASE` expression now uses `WHERE id IN (...)` to avoid setting NULL positions on non-listed items.
- **Post-commit hook**: Now extracts task ID from context before creating checkpoints, preventing silent failures.
- **Dead code**: Removed 17 unused functions across 5 modules, eliminating ~1882 lines of dead code.
- **Empty files**: Cleaned up 4 empty stub files left after dead code removal.
- **nfpm version**: Packaging config version synced with Cargo.toml.

### Security

- **Supply chain**: All dependencies scanned via `cargo deny` and `cargo audit` — 0 vulnerabilities across 152 dependencies.
- **Code safety**: 100% safe Rust — zero `unsafe` blocks, zero `unwrap()`/`expect()` in production code.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Project Prune**: New `ctxctl project prune --older-than <days>` command clears old completed tasks to keep the database lightweight.
- **Remote Synchronization**: New `ctxctl sync push/pull` commands to backup and retrieve state across environments.
- **Agent Analytics**: New `ctxctl stats` command outputs tabular metrics and session durations for each active agent.

### Fixed

- **Windows Build**: Fixed a compilation error on Windows by properly gating UNIX-only filesystem permission logic in `hooks.rs`.
- **Dependencies**: Replaced deprecated `Ulid::new()` with `Ulid::generate()` following the `ulid` v3.0.0 crate update.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Shell completions**: New `ctxctl completions <shell>` command generates completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell via `clap_complete`.
- **Git hooks integration**: New `ctxctl hooks install/uninstall/status` commands install `post-commit` and `prepare-commit-msg` hooks that auto-checkpoint on commit and prepend task IDs to commit messages.
- **Enhanced Doctor**: `ctxctl doctor` now detects orphaned tasks (owners deleted), reports active session count, shows git hook installation status with fix hints, and renders human-readable output by default.
- **Code modularisation**: All CLI command handlers extracted from `main.rs` into individual modules under `src/commands/` (e.g. `task.rs`, `session.rs`, `hooks.rs`, `completions.rs`), reducing `main.rs` from ~3100 lines to ~350 lines.
